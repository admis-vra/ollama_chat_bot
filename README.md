# ollama_chat_bot
Full Project Description (for README or About section)

This project is a lightweight command-line chat assistant built with Python and Ollama.
It allows you to talk to local large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 3.2, Mistral, or Gemma, right from your terminal — without needing an internet connection or API key.

The script demonstrates how to send structured messages (system, user) to an Ollama model and print back responses in real-time. It’s clean, minimal, and great for beginners learning how to interact with AI models locally.

You can easily:
~ Change the model name in one line.
~ Edit the system prompt to create your own chatbot personality.
~ Use it as a template for future AI projects or automation tools.
